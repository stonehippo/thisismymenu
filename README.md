Philosophy
----------

Restaurant websites are terrible.

Randomly take a look at restaurant websites out there, and you'll find that most of them are pretty awful at best and simply unusable at worst. Confusing layouts, heavy use of Flash, and super-slow speeds are common.

The goal of *thisismymenu* is provide restaurants with a modern template for building their website. It focuses on providing the core information that people coming to your site are looking for:

* Where you are
* When you're open
* How to contact you
* What's on your menu and how much

The experience of browsing your site has been optimized for both human and machine readers. This means that people coming to your site can find the stuff they're looking for. It also means that search engines like Google can extract that sort of information from your site that will help them present better results about your site.

*thisismymenu* eschews the cruft that plagues many restaurant sites. There's no Flash, no carousel animations or fancy features. You can add that stuff if you think it will help sell folks on coming to dine with you. But I recommend that you think twice before adding this sort of thing. While it's not a bad idea to add some salt, over-seasoning can ruin your dish. This applies to websites just as much as it does to cooking.
