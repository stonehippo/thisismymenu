ThisIsMyMenu, Plain Old HTML5 Version
====================================

This is the simplest version of ThisIsMyMenu, using plain old HTML5, CSS and Javascript. There are no fancy tools required to maintain this version of the template: simply crack open the files and start making changes.

Why You Should (Not) Use The Simple Version
-------------------------------------------

The upside of using this version is that it is very easy to edit and it's static, so you should be able to deploy it just about anywhere. The downside is that you don't get the benefit of using the tools that the other versions of ThisIsMyMenu rely on to management content.

I don't really recommend using this version of the template. I suspect you'll get much more mileage from the managed version of the template, and I encourage you to take the time to learn the tools that provide the benefits.
